A deep learning-based image classification project aimed at detecting COVID-19 from chest X-ray images using popular CNN architectures: **ResNet50**, **VGG16**, and **AlexNet**. This project is implemented using both **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch**, trained on a dataset of over **1600 chest X-ray images**.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to detect the presence of COVID-19 infection from chest X-ray images using deep learning models. Early detection through X-ray imaging can significantly help in fast and non-invasive diagnosis, especially in remote and resource-limited areas.
